# Purpose

This article is the description and readme for the [netapp/ez-rancher](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/netapp/ez-rancher) repository at DockerHub.  The intention is to keep the description and readme in sync with the functionality of this repository as it evolves.  The means to update the text at DockerHub is not fancy:  a repository admin should copy and paste the description and readme in lieu of an API to update.
